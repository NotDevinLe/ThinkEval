    You are generating a **{difficulty} difficulty** Connections-style puzzle based on the story below.

    Story:
    \"\"\"
    {story}
    \"\"\"

    Your task is to generate **exactly 4 distinct word categories**, each with 10 **single-word** entries.
    The categories must be creative, logically consistent, and clearly different.
    - Do NOT include multi-word phrases.
    - All words must be unique across the entire puzzle (no word should appear in more than one category).
    - However, you are encouraged to include words that could plausibly fit into more than one category to introduce added difficulty

    For each category:
    - Provide a **short, clear category name**
    - List **10 single words** that fit
    - Add a 1-sentence explanation of the logic

    Use this format exactly:

    Category: <name>  
    Words: <word1>, <word2>, ..., <word10>  
    Explanation: <one-line logic>
